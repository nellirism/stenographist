    "note": "Characters are portrayed stunningly. \nRuairi O'Connor made a powerful performance. \nBoth Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are as always, very effective in the roles of Lorraine and Ed Warren. \nThe tension building up in the climax was supported by the strong performance of the antagonist.
